The sustainable fishing game
:::

::: p
The Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in
fishing or marine conservation through fun play. The main goal of the
game is to collect the maximum number of points from catching fish while
also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish size diversity for future
catches. The game is suitable to ages from 10 to 99+ and is best played
in a group of 2-5 players.

Game mechanics
:::

![](images/BandedMorwong.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

::: p
Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted
to catch them. But presence of big fish also allows players to draw new
cards, spawn new fish and also grow them. The player has to find a
balance between collecting points by catching fish and preserving fish
for good fishing opportunities. In addition to fishing, other natural
and human induced events occur throughout the game, such as fisheries
research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal fishing, ocean
acidification and others. These events create unpredictability and new
challenges and inform about human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

Main messages
:::

::: p
This game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about:

::: ol
1.  <bf>Big fish are important.</bf> Big fish are important for
    population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are
    beautiful.

2.  <bf>Big fish are mostly all gone.</bf> Commercial and recreational
    fishing has removed most of the big fish from our oceans, lakes and
    rivers.

3.  <bf>Big fish can return.</bf> Fish grow relatively fast. If we take
    the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their
    beauty within our lifetimes.
