The Big Fish card game aims to inform and engage everyone interested in
fishing or marine conservation through fun play.

The main goal of the game is to collect the maximum number of points
from catching fish while also preserving a healthy ecosystem and fish
size diversity for future catches.
<!-- The game is suitable to ages from 10 to 99+ and is best played in a group of 2-5 players. -->

Playing the game
:::

::: text-center
Big fish are worth more points than small fish, so players are tempted
to catch them. But the presence of big fish in the ecosystem allows
players to draw new cards, spawn new fish, and grow more big fish!

Players must find a balance between collecting points (by catching fish)
and preserving enough fish for future fishing. In addition to fishing,
other natural and human-induced events occur throughout the game, such
as fisheries research, poor water quality, citizen science, illegal
fishing, ocean acidification and others. These events create
unpredictability and new challenges, and inform players about human
impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

Messages

This game aims to introduce three main messages that we care about:

::: ol
1.  <bf>Big fish are important.</bf> Big fish are important for
    population resilience, ecosystem balance and simply because they are
    beautiful.

2.  <bf>Big fish are mostly all gone.</bf> Commercial and recreational
    fishing has removed most of the big fish from our oceans, lakes and
    rivers.

3.  <bf>Big fish can return.</bf> Fish grow relatively fast. If we take
    the right measures, we can restore healthy ecosystems and their
    beauty within our lifetimes.
