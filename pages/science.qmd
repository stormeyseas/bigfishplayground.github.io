# The Cards

::: callout-caution
I'm thinking maybe a gallery/carousel  of all the wildcards and round-end cards, each of which links to their section on the correct page. 

That or maybe just two buttons, eg:
:::

:::::::: container
::::::: {.row .d-flex .max-width}

:::: {.col .buffer-flex}
<!-- empty buffer column -->
::::

:::: {.col .buffer-flex}
::: {.h3 .text-center}
[Wildcards](wildCards.qmd#sec-wild-cards)
:::
::::

:::: {.col .buffer-fixed-10}
<!-- empty buffer column -->
::::

:::: {.col .buffer-flex}
::: {.h3 .text-center}
[Round-end cards](wildCards.qmd#sec-round-end-cards)
:::
::::

:::: {.col .buffer-flex}
<!-- empty buffer column -->
::::

:::::::

::::::: {.row .d-flex .max-width}

:::: {.col .buffer-flex}
<!-- empty buffer column -->
::::

:::: {.col .align-self-center .fixed-width}
::: {.image-container .image-card}
[<img src="/images/cards/placeholder.png" width="250px"/>](wildCards.qmd#sec-wild-cards)
:::
::::

:::: {.col .buffer-fixed-10 style="margin-right: 7.5%; margin-left: 7.5%;"}
<!-- empty buffer column -->
